# Task Timer

This Task timer is a React project where user adds new tasks and start, pause, stops the task.\
This is a first project working with React to learn and improve my React and front-end skills.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run serve`
Starts the JSON server where the tasks are fetched.\

## Future improvements
In the future the task timer should save stopped tasks in the database and display the generated summary of the tasks and the spent time.
